They hold enormous potential for efficiency, expenditure control and policy accuracy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Predictive analysis<\/strong> is only one example of a set of new practices : <strong>data-driven strategies<\/strong>, which for example allow :<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To regulate an industrial sector by a releasing relevant data \u2018 as the French government is <a href=\"https:\/\/le.taxi\">experimenting<\/a> with geolocation data from taxis to enable them to benefit from digital services;<\/li><li>To organize information so that individual public servants can take better decisions;<\/li><li>To improve the day-to-day work of front-office staff by providing them with more real-time information;<\/li><li>To increase the autonomy and freedom of choice for public service \nusers \u2018 for example in predicting the likeliness of a successful legal \nprocedure.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These promises carried by data sciences are at the core of the <strong>digital transformation<\/strong> of big companies and large cities worldwide and are one of the levers for the modernisation of public action. This implies <strong>integrating new skill sets in government teams<\/strong>:\n data scientists, statisticians with innovative profiles, computer \ngeeks, keen on new data-processing methods, and concerned with the \nconcrete impact and translation of their mathematical results. It \nrequires high-quality data \u2018 that France does indeed produce and handle \nfollowing a long-standing tradition, thanks to its high standard \nstatistics and its commitment to the quality of public service. It also \nrequires <strong>an enhanced culture of \u00e9?data-driven strategies\u00e9?<\/strong>,\n an ambition to carry this type of change and the patience to \ncontinuously test and verify whether small changes can produce major \nimprovements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The correct implementation of these methods, however, requires a prior effective <strong>data governance<\/strong>,\n i.e. global management of data produced or held by government to ensure\n the quality, freshness, interoperability and availability in the \ncorrect formats, facilitating swift use and dissemination amongst public\n servants \u2018from central and local governments \u2018so that they receive the \ninformation necessary to the performance of their tasks in compliance \nwith important statutory secrets that protect fundamental freedoms and \nthe nation\u2019s fundamental interests.
